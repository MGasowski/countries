# Country listing app

This is a create-react-app based application.
You can browse and search countries, filter by continent and see their details with this app.

I used Apollo Client to fetch data from [api](https://countries.trevorblades.com/)

For styling I mainly used TailwindCSS. Application offers automatic dark mode synchronized with your operating system theme.
